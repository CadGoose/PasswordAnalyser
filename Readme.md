# Password Strength Analyzer ðŸ”’
By @CadGoose

## Overview
The **Password Strength Analyzer** is a Python-based tool designed to assess the strength of a password and provide feedback to help improve its security. With the growing risk of online attacks, this tool can help users create safer passwords by flagging weak patterns and avoiding common vulnerabilities.

This analyzer checks passwords against common security criteria (length, complexity, and common patterns) and gives an **estimated time to crack** based on current cracking capabilities. It even simulates testing the password against known password-cracking databases, helping users better understand real-world security practices.


The output will indicate the strength, estimated time to crack, and suggestions for improving the password.

How It Works
The script uses regular expressions and a list of common passwords to analyze:

Length: Passwords should be at least 8 characters.

Character Diversity: Checks for uppercase, lowercase, numeric, and special characters.

Common Patterns: Warns against using predictable or overused passwords (like '123456' or 'password').

Disclaimer
This tool provides a general estimate and feedback but does not guarantee complete security. For highly sensitive information, always follow additional security best practices.

The script will analyze the password and provide feedback on its strength and security.

By following these steps and using the provided script, you can offer a practical and educational tool for password security. Let me know if you need any further adjustments or additions!


## Features
- **Strength Analysis**: Assesses password strength as Weak, Moderate, or Strong.
- **Time-to-Crack Estimate**: Calculates how long it would take to crack the password with brute-force techniques.
- **Detailed Feedback**: Provides actionable feedback if the password doesn't meet security best practices.
- **Common Password Check**: Tests the password against a list of known, commonly-used weak passwords to avoid easy compromises.

## Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Run the script in a Python environment.
3. Enter a password when prompted, and receive detailed feedback and strength evaluation.

### Example usage:
```sh
$ python password_strength_analyzer.py
Enter a password to test its strength: MySecurePass123!
